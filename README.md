# Visualg Algorithms

This repository contais a collection of algorithms solved using Visualg, categorized by difficulty and topics.

## Repository Structure

- 'sequential-structures/': Basic algorithms control flow.
- 'conditional-structures/': Algorithms using conditional structures like 'if' and 'else'.
- 'loop-structures/': Algorithms using loops such as 'for', 'while', and 'repeat'.
- 'composite-conditions/': Algorithms that involve complex conditions with multiple criteria.
- 'arrays/': Algorithms utilizing arrays and their manipulations.
- 'matrices/': Algorithms that work with two-dimensional arrays.

  ## How to Run

  To run these algorithmsm, you need the **Visualg** software installed. You can download it (https://sourceforge.net/projects/visualg30/). Once downloaded, open the '.alg' file in Visualg and run the code.

  ## Credits
